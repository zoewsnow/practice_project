        <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>

        <p> Hello world! This is my site to practice coding in HTML and CSS. Hopefully, by the end of this project, I have a platform for creating sites like Tara!</p>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>

        <p>I'm mainly focused on getting a basic understanding of how HTML works.</p>

        <p>That being said, I'm open to any functionality really! I'm excited to pull code from other websites and intertwine it into my code so that I can build out the CSS and integrations. I also want to know how to include various apis into the platform.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>

        <p>From here, I'm going to have to learn how to format this website using CSS!</p>

        <h2>Article 2 on my growth</h2>

        <p>For this, I would like to say, TAKE 2!</p>
